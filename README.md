# Lab-1-AIDI-2004

This repo contains the decision tree algorithm performed on diabetes dataset.

The dataframe has three columns: age, bp (blood pressure), and diabetes. Here, age and bp are the features and diabetes is the label. We’re going to predict whether or not a person is suffering from diabetes using the person’s age and blood pressure value.
